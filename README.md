# Smart_Home_Automation_Using_Bluetooth_Embedded
Main_Code
•	This project aims to develop a smart home automation system wherein general electrical home appliances and emergency alert systems are interfaced and controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth of an Android-based smartphone.
•	The smartphone-based GUI provides the user, the ease and comfort of controlling one’s home in the palm of their hands.
•	The GUI has buttons on it to give control of lights (LEDs), analogous to physical switches. Moreover, the system also provides the feedback of the current status of each of the LEDs, whether it is ON or OFF, and displays it on the smartphone’s GUI.
•	The system also consists of a smoke sensor, which triggers an alarm on the connected smartphone and alerting the user, if it detects presence of gases/smoke beyond safety limits.
